# cardetection

1. Used detect.py to check how OD works
2. yolo_on_loop is used to loop for the detection
3. plotlinesonimage shows how lines are drawn on the image
4. getBBoxes gives info about bounding boxes predicted by yolo on an image
5. use result.py to convert predictes images to video frames

# Open for suggestions --thanks :)
